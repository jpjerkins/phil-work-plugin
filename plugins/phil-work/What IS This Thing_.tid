Welcome to the inside of Phil's head!

!! Finding Information
You can find information in any of the following ways:

* ''Search''
** Just type into the search box.  Title matches will be listed first; full-text matches will be listed below.
** Good things to search for:
*** "PROD", "INTG", etc.
*** Dates in "2019-03-14" format
*** Technology names - "~ElasticSearch", "Kafka", "Powershell", etc.
* ''Recent'' - Click this tab, and it'll show you the most-recently edited tiddlers by edit time order.

!! Getting Started Fast
* Click the {{$:/core/images/edit-button}} icon on the top-right of any tiddler to edit it
* Click the {{$:/core/images/new-button}} icon above the search box to create a new tiddler
* The {{$:/core/images/down-arrow}} icon on the top-right of any tiddler has a bunch of cool things you can do.
** Example: The "new here" option will create a new tiddler tagged with the current tiddler's title.  That makes it easy to track a train-of-thought path, while keeping individual thoughts separate.
* Don't forget to download [[Tiddly Desktop|https://tiddlywiki.com/#TiddlyDesktop]]
* And, as always, there's http://tiddlywiki.com :-)

!! ~TiddlyWiki [[Core Concepts|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Concepts]]
* Always remember that [[TiddlyWiki likes small, fine-grained tiddlers|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Philosophy%20of%20Tiddlers]].  It's optimized to find and render them quickly.  Most of the UI (including everything in the menu/nav bar on the right) is composed of small tiddlers.  How small?  Every button in the UI is its own tiddler, and has a tag saying it belongs in that place.  So if you ever find yourself adding to a tiddler that's taller than one page, consider breaking it up and transcluding it in (see the  icon in the editor's toolbar).
* There are [[many|https://tiddlywiki.com/#list-links%20Macro]] [[ways|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Contents]] to [[list|https://tiddlywiki.com/#ListWidget]] and [[render|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Transclusion]] tiddlers based on a filter.  Playing with this will give you your first taste of ~TiddlyWiki's true power.  Example: [[$:/plugins/pjerkins/phil-work/To Do]]
* There are [[many|https://tiddlywiki.com/#CheckboxWidget]] [[widgets|https://tiddlywiki.com/#ButtonWidget]] that manipulate [[tiddlers|https://tiddlywiki.com/#ActionCreateTiddlerWidget]] and [[their fields|https://tiddlywiki.com/#ActionListopsWidget]].  These expose yet another level of ~TiddlyWiki's capabilities.
